## Overview

Ferrobending is an is a rare innate genetic ability found amongst sentient humanoids, and on exceeding rare occasions, dragons. Ferrobending allows the user to manipulate the position of ferrous-metal atoms which are either directly in contact with their skin or in contact with a chain of ferrous-metal atoms which lead back to skin contact.

Ferrobending has had significant impact on civilisation, with ferrobenders dominating the battlefield, even after the invention of gunpowder.

Ferrobending is considered a magical/demonic phenomena as it breaks thermodynamic and Newtonian laws.

## Laws of Ferrobending

The seven primary laws of Ferrobending are laid out by Dutch scientist Dr Erich Faulkner's study *Observations and Classification of the Ferrobending Phenomena*, published in 1789.

1. Metallic matter may be compelled to change its position by a ferrobender.
2. Metallic matter may only move if a portion of it is in contact with a ferrobenders skin.
3. When Metallic matter is being compelled, the effects of gravity upon it is reduced by a factor of 16.
4. Metallic matter of pure iron is the easiest to compel. Metallic matter further from iron is more difficult to compel.
5. Metallic matter becomes more difficult to compel as distance to the ferrobender increases.
6. Ferrobending consumes the users red blood cells.
7. The difficulty of ferrobending, and the consumption of red blood cells, is dependent upon the ferrobenders position upon the Faulkner scale.

##### Additional Notes:
While the effect of gravity is reduced greatly, the mass of a ferrobender retains the metal that they are wielding.

> *"The Elf woman, who I had been talking to only a moment before, rounded the corner of the warehouse. What had been a 60 kilo, 5'4 youngster now looked positively terrifying, standing at 6 foot, coated in half of the steel from front of a train engine. The metal flowed back from her head for a moment, allowing her to yell out a warning. I struck at the werewolf's snout with the end of my rifle, sending it reeling, then leap aside as 1200 kg of Elf and steel charged past me. She grabbed the werewolf and then took it through 3 brick walls before she finally came to a stop.\"* 

The speed at which metal can be compelled is determined by the difficulty of the metal and the ferrobenders ability.

As metal is compelled to move, it carries with it minimal kinetic force, only enough to flow into air. Expert ferrobenders are able to use a technique which overcomes this somewhat, see [[#Tentacles|Tentacles]].

Ferrobenders are not able to "feel", through controlled metal. Though they are granted an additional sense, allowing them to understand which bits of metal are under their control, and a vague awareness of the surroundings of controlled metal, dependent of ferrobending ability and proximity of the metal to the ferrobenders skin.
### The Faulkner scale
The Fahlkner scale measures a person's "attunement" to their ferrobending ability.

Dr Fahlkner saw fit to divide users into 8 tiers of ability, measured in "Faulkner", or "Fauls" for short. While all ferrobenders differ in their precise ability, the division into 8 segments provides an easy heuristic for someone to gauge ferrobending ability.

To determine where an individual sits on each scale, Faulkner devised the Ferrobending Aptitude Test.

##### Ferrobending Aptitude Test
In this test, a subject attempts to complete a series of tasks which indicates their ferrobending ability. 

Faulkner stresses that each task must be completed *"comfortably, and without undue strain on the participant"*. 

As such, following the completion of the highest difficulty task, the participant must complete a 2 mile run, without fainting due to blood deficiency.

**0 Fauls** - Subject able to cause slight, imprecise distortions in iron. This does not constitute a ferrobender, and is prevalent in ~30% of the population.

**1 Fauls** - Subject able to manipulate a volume of 15 cm cubed of pure iron into a distinct tool (Dr Faulkner recommends a mallet, a dagger and a screwdriver in his original paper). Passing this test qualifies one officially as a ferrobender and is present in ~2% of world populations.

**2 Fauls** - Subject able to form a partial steelskin out of pure iron from 50 cm cubed.

**3 Fauls** - Subject able to form a full steelskin out of pure iron of an average thickness no less than !!!!! cm.

**4 Fauls** - Subject able to form a full steelskin out of an equal part iron, lead and aluminium alloy of an average thickness no less than !!!!!! cm.

**5 Fauls** - Subject able to lift no less than twice their bodyweight while in steelskin.

**6 Fauls** - Subject able to manipulate two cubic meters of steel.

**7 Fauls** - Subject able to manipulate five cubic meters of steel.

**8 Fauls** - Subject able to manipulate ten cubic meters of steel.
#### Improvement through Practice
Like with fleshworking, a ferrobender will be able to increase their attunement through the use of their abilities.

All beginner ferrobenders start at an ability of 1 Fauls and quickly gain aptitude as they practice. Predetermined genetic factors determine one's "potential" for ferrobending - The highest possible Faulkner tier they can achieve.

Gains in ferrobending ability start off quickly, and diminish with experience as one approaches their potential.

## Ferrobending abilities

The most obvious use of ferrobending is the formation of tools and disruption of metal constructions. Ferrobenders make terrifying adversaries in hand to hand combat, given their ability to rearrange a given metal weapons composition, mid swing or thrust.

Ferrobenders have the ability to 'melt' locks and fuse other metal components together, like engines or handcuffs.
##### Steelskin
Ferrobenders of 2 Fauls and higher have the ability to meld metal to cover their skin, known as a 'steelskin', providing them with enhanced protection and greater mass.

Modern combat ferrobenders of significant ability are commonly used as assault infantry, capable of charging down machine guns and rifle fire unharmed while within a steelskin.

Prior to the invention of gunpowder, ferrobenders needed only to be able to protect themselves against bladed and blunt instruments. Allowing the steelskin to be worn atop of clothes.

In the modern day however, combat ferrobenders require every additional millimetre of thickness in protection against bullets, explosives and shrapnel. Combat ferrobenders wear clothing atop their steelskin, allowing for more even and efficient metal distribution, but leaving ferrobenders highly vulnerable to the cold. The effect of metal against bare skin or thin under layers commonly results in ferrobenders becoming exhausted or suffering hypothermia in cold battles.

Ferrobenders will specifically tailor the blend of metals used in their steelskin to give a good balance of mobility, mass, and protection, while still being sustainable within their ferrobending ability. 

Vision from within a steelskin varies based on the ability of the ferrobender. While keeping close against the skin for the rest of the body, ferrobenders will fashion the metal protecting their heads into different shapes, give greater protection and allowing for external vision. 
- Lower Faul ferrobenders commonly form their head protection into two planes, one running perpendicular to each cheek, allowing for a slanted horizontal slit to give vision. Similar to a suit of knights armour.
- Higher Faul ferrobenders take artistic license with their head protection, taking its design as a point of pride. The finer control over their metal allows them to have finer slits or grills for vision.
- Extremely competent ferrobenders will often not need to rely of their own human vision, and will rely entirely upon the sense granted by their controlled metal.

When two ferrobenders engage in hand to hand combat, each assailant will attempt to 'tear' pieces of the other's steelskin off and throw it away, hoping to weaken the average thickness or leave an exposed hole from which the assailant's body can be damaged. Ferrobenders engaged in a fistfight engage in a delicate balance of shifting metal to different parts of their body as they loose more of their steelskin.
##### Ferromuscle
Ferrobenders of sufficient ability (5+ Fauls) find themselves able to intuitively form the metal on their steelskin into an external musculature, which grants them significant additional strength.

High Faul ferrobenders can be differentiated from lower Faul ferrobenders by the appearance of their steelskins.
- Low Faul steelskins appear as an extension, or expansion, of the body it encompasses. This can make wearers appear clumsy and bloated in some cases.
- High Faul steelskins, which utilise ferromuscle, appear lean, agile and muscular, the rare sight of which inspiring dread within enemy soldiers.

The significant additional strength provided by ferromuscle gives ferrobenders the ability to life many times their body weight, sprint at speeds comparable to motor vehicles and leap great distances into the air. Controlling the huge weight of the steelskin becomes the primary problem for high Faul ferrobenders.
##### Anti-Armour
Any ferrobender has the potential to deliver significant damage to tanks and other armoured vehicles by tearing holes through armour and compelling metallic mechanical pieces to become inoperable.

A ferrobender of a sufficient ability (Usually 4-5 Fauls) has the ability to crush a tank through the touch of a hand, killing the crew. As such, anti-ferrobending measures, such as a thick zinc coating or wood panelling, are instituted on modern tanks in an attempt to improve tank suitability.

## Prevalence & Geographic Distribution

Active ferrobending is typically passed down through family lineages. Being a recessive genetic feature, Ferrobending can, through chance, become dormant even with two ferrobending parents or become active in child to two non-ferrobending parents.

Active ferrobenders exhibiting an ability of 2 Fauls or higher typically make up less than 2% of eligible populations. Ferrobending has a strong geographic prevalence in [[Republic of Centuria|Centuria]], with Prussia having an estimated 7% of its population 2+ Faul ferrobenders.

## History

During the Dragon Age, prominent ferrobending families would quickly enter the elite class through military service of a dragon lord. In the case of the Centurian and Roman Empires, local dragon lords would ensure ferrobenders served as commanders of military units. This ensured that, when waging war or crushing rebellion, each military detachment would be hold an extreme advantage against regular enemy forces.

Prior to the invention of gunpowder, high-Faul Ferrobenders were the only weapon capable to kill dragons, and as such were considered highly dangerous.

Ferrobenders born from non-ferrobending parents would be shunned or killed at a young age in an effort to keep subject populations subservient.
