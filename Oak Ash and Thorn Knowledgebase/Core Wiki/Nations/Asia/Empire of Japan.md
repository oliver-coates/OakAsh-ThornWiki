>*"The spirit of the Japanese Nation is, but its nature, a thing that must be propagated over the seven seas and extended over the five continents."*

## Overview:
The Japanese isles had been ruled over by numerous dragon emperors, descending from Siberia, flying west from China or rising from the Pacific Ocean to fight for dominance. This would change in 1854 when a Royal Navy expedition killed one of the dragon lords, opening the islands to trade and shattering the Japanese people’s confidence in their dragon rulership. As foreign influence and new technology destabilized the country, the Meiji revolution of 1868 deposed dragon rulership and enthroned Emperor Meiji as the first human emperor of Japan. In the 50 years of westernization that followed, Japan has transformed itself from a feudal nation into the burgeoning empire of Asia.
