### Prehistory
The first humans who descended from the Garden of Eden, or, as some scientists believe, emerged from the primordial African wilderness, lived nasty, short, brutish lives.

Small clumps of disorganised tribes, huddled around fires. Terrified of the beasts of all kind which rules the air and the night.

What little information we are able to draw from early man shows highly ritualistic, warrior societies living in near constant conflict.

### Age of the Dragon
##### Early Agriculture
The discovery of agriculture in Mesopotamia brought a change in human society.

For the first time in known history, static groups of humans could grow meagre crops and begin to develop the first traces of civilisation. Once these small villages and towns learned to trap, feed and eventually domesticate animals for farming, they offered up much of their meat in an attempt to satiate the winged beasts which had terrorised them.
##### Dragon Lords
This, as Darwin proposed, kick-started an evolutionary arms race among dragons. Lording over, and providing protection to, human tribes provided a far greater and more stable source of calories for Dragons. The ensuing competition amongst Dragons necessitated ever increasing strength, size and intelligence.

According to the 'evolutionists' - Darwin and his Ilk - It was across this early civilisation period that what we call today as 'Greater Dragons' emerged, adapted for combat and governance from the ancient equivalent of today's 'Lesser Dragons', which are adapted for hunting.

These Greater Dragons grew to colossal sizes, stopped only by the laws of aeronautics, and developed cunning intellects. How Dragons developed speech is strongly debated, the most current theory is that their vestigial communicative organs were pressured to become more refined and complex over time, allowing Dragons to take a direct role in the governance of the people they ruled.

Dragons first became rulers, then as civilisation expanded, kings and were finally worshipped as gods by these early peoples.
##### Demon Kings
The rise of civilisation brought with it a new danger. Demons thrived within the newly erected cities and towns. Whereas before Demons could be avoided or escaped among the wilderness, they now posed a far more dangerous threat those living in close proximity.

One of the primary duties of the Dragon Lords were to defend their subjects from Demons. Legends speak of times on the borders of the known world in which peoples who had no Dragon, or whose Dragon had been slain would fall to Demonic individuals.

Demon Kings would lord over these peoples, bringing the chaos and degeneration typical with their unrestricted power. Archaeology shows that this was typically short lived, as seen with the Amorites and Cannanites. Civilisations in decay, lorded over by a Demon King, were either invaded or simply dissipated within a few generations due to widespread infertility.

##### Empires
As civilisation grew outwards from the Mesopotamia and the Indus valley, Large, continent spanning empires, rose under the rule of the strongest Dragons.

These Empires were typically organised with an emperor, the oldest dragon ruling from the imperial capitol, holding sole reproductive rights. The Dragon's children would be appointed as rulers over the numerous provinces and sub-provinces of the empire, usually in order of seniority.

This hierarchical, familial, imperial rulership would remain for hundreds of years at a time, given their exceptionally long lifespans. When the Emperor became too old or sickly, they would either resign or be forced from the throne by one of their sons. This would typically trigger a period of  turmoil as the strongest members of the imperial family would fight for dominance, splintering parts of the empire into factions. This period of internal war and instability would help to cull the elite classes and secure to the new the loyalty of their chosen faction.
### Age of Man
##### Jesus of Nazareth
Within the Roman Imperial province of Judea, a Jewish Carpenter, Jesus of Nazareth rose to prominence with reported miracles and revolutionary religious and philosophical teachings.

Jesus broke with the orthodox Jewish religious understanding, expanding their concepts of a singular, omnipresent omnipotent God into a God of 3 persons, with an interest in the life of each and every man and woman. This new branch of Judaism, which would break off into a separate religion entirely, placed extreme emphasis against the worship of both Demons and Dragons.

Modern historians mark the Crucifixion of the Jesus Christ as the end of the Dragon age, and the beginning of the age of Man. Christianity would spread rapidly through the declining Roman Empire, facing extreme persecution for their resistance to Dragon worship.

##### The Prophet Muhammad
Six hundred years following beginning of this new age, another religious leader, a [Titan class](Ferrobending) ferrobender and warlord, Muhammad rose to prominence in Mecca. Teaching an even more radical anti-dragon religious thought, declaring no difference between Dragons and Demons, Muhammad united the disparate tribes of Arabia and expanded into the neighbouring Byzantine and Sasanian Empires. 

Despite the slaying of hundreds of Dragons and numerous military victories, the death of Muhammad in 632AD would end Muslim expansion. The remaining Dragon Lords would confine Islam to Arabia, unwilling to conquer the now unruly, militant people.
