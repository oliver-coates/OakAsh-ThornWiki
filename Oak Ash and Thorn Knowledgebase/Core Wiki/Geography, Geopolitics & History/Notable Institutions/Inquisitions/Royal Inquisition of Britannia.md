## History

## Structure & Culture

The Britannian Inquisition is a uniquely decentralised and individualistic organisation. Developing out of early Anglo-Saxon demon hunting practices, the Inquisition emphases the role and authority of individual veteran inquisitors, free to act of their own accord. The fear of a centralised, managerial inquisition devolving into tyranny and demon worship is consistently reinforced by events on the European mainland, most notably the rise of the SS within Centuria.

#### Authority of Inquisitors
Second in authority only to the crown itself, Brittanian inquisitors have near-total power to requisition resources or issue commands, even to military units. In Brittanian society, a twenty year old junior inquisitor is superior in rank to a military general or cabinet minister. 

Britannian society places huge reverence on their inquisitors, and orders given by them are rarely disobeyed. Refusal to comply with an inquisitorial order is treason of the highest degree, can be sentenced by inquisitors immediately and without trial, and is punished by summary execution which is usually delivered by the inquisitor in question. 

The total trust given by Britannian society to their Inquisitors is considered sacred in Brittanian Inquisitorial culture. Misuse of this Inquisitorial power is the most common cause of an Inquisitorial Trial, and usually results in execution.

#### Arch-Inquisitor
Arch-inquisitors are veteran inquisitors tasked with bureaucracy, conflict settlement and institutional supervision. The role is considered a burden by most inquisitors, who typically prefer ground work, and is passed from inquisitor to inquisitor on a bi-yearly basis.

#### Inquisitorial Trials
In the rare cases of inquisitorial misconduct, an ad-hoc inquisitorial trial can be called by an inquisitor. Adjudicated by an arch-inquisitor, the accused inquisitor is judged by a group (Between 5 and 12) of fellow inquisitors in geographic proximity. Through a unanimous verdict, the accused inquisitor given a punishment deemed appropriate of their peers, usually either:
- Immediate execution, or
- In rare cases, excommunication - Seizure of all property and life in exile.

#### Inquisitorial Action Group
The Royal Inquisition staffs a number of tactical groups, which serve as quick response groups to demonic threats. Each Inquisitorial Action Group (IAG) usually consists of 4-8 Inquisitors, with a compliment of up to 1000 men-at-arms drafted from the Imperial Institute.
