## Overview:

The Kingdom of Poland is a human kingdom in Central Europe. It borders the [[Republic of Centuria | Centurial Republic]] to its west and Russia to its east. Born out of the collapse of the Centurian Empire, the Kingdom of Poland is a young state in Europe, suffering extensively from organized crime and poverty in its hinterlands. Poland is governed by King Frederick the 1st of Lithuania, of the Poniatowski noble family. Poland would be invaded by the Centurian Republic at the outset of the Reclamation War, with the nation’s capital Warsaw falling in early 1940.

## History:

> _“Only the sword now carries any weight in the balance for the destiny of a nation.”_

In ~110BC, the area and people known as Poland today, though not under a unified culture or language, was invaded by the Centurian Empire. Dragon Emperor Teutonus installed his second son Cythus as Grand Duke of Poland. Cythus would then govern Poland as the 2nd Imperial Provence of the Empire.

### Poland under Centurian Rule

Industrialization reached Poland properly in the middle of the 19th Century, as industrial development overflowed from both Prussia and the Rhineland. Under direction of the Grand Duke, Poland quickly became a proprietary industrial zone, managing the influx of raw materials from the eastern Russian states through to the Empire’s industrial heartland. Cities such as Kraków, Warsaw and Białystok grew rapidly to become railway hubs and material processing zones. At the Empire’s industrial height nearing the turn of century, Poland’s industrial cities were receiving the majority of lumber, grain, oil and metals from Russian industrial zones, which were to be processed and then sent deeper into the Empire.

### Collapse & Revolution

The unrest and disorder in the Empire’s eastern provinces, beginning in the winter of 1917, caused huge disruptions to the supply of raw materials into Poland’s industrial cities. The resultant factory shutdowns, coupled with an exceptionally harsh winter sparked widespread unrest throughout Poland’s industrial centres. Shorty after, the revolutions and defections in Empire’s Russian provinces brought lawlessness, banditry and an influx of refugees to Poland’s border. The growing instability of the nation, coupled with the numerous threats along the eastern border and the Empire’s apparent inability to police them triggered a small coup within Poland’s wealthy elite. The Poniatowski family, a very well respected family of lawyers, military officers and bankers, lead a group of other wealthy families, representing the majority of the Polish and Centurian elite within the nation in the formation of the 1st Emergency Council. The Emergency Council was an ad-hoc semi-governmental body which took on the role of restoring law and order to the industrialized cities. The Emergency Council hired mercenaries, formed civilian militia groups and assumed control over many Imperial garrisons, who had begun to defect or disband after weeks without pay or supplies. The Emergency Council’s militia forces were very effective at restoring order to the unstable nation. Though only intended to be a temporary measure until the Empire could reassert itself, the ongoing troubles within Anderia and even the Empire’s heartland brought the idea of Polish independence from a far off dream to a very-near reality. On the 4th of June, 1918 The Centurian Empire declared the Emergency Council an illegal body following a small skirmish between Centurian soldiers and Emergency Council militiamen at the Kraków garrison. Days later, the Emergency Council declared Poland an independent state, beginning the Independence War.

### Polish War for Independence

By late 1918, Imperial forces within Poland’s heartland had atrophied to such an extent that the Polish revolutionaries were able to seize control of the major cities of Kraków, Warsaw and Białystok with little fighting within a week of the revolution beginning. On the 26th of June, an Ad-hoc Centurian army under control of General Alfred von Böckmann crossed from Prussia and begun a march on Warsaw. This Centurian army consisted of 3 exhausted, but elite divisions, numbering 37,000 men. The Polish Government, formerly the Emergency Council, mustered the 1st Army of Poland under the command of former Imperial General Józef Piłsudski. The Polish first army numbered 26,000 men made up of former imperial soldiers, mercenaries and civilian militia. Polish forces ambushed the Centurian army on the 2nd of August as it begun to cross the Vistula river, thereby starting the battle of the Vistula. Weeks of bloody, active fighting followed, quite unlike the static trench warfare of Continental War.

### Battle of the Vistula

The Polish first army engaged the Centurians as they made their bridgeheads across the Vistula, bogging the Centurian assault forces down in fierce bridge fighting where their superior numbers and fighting ability could not be properly utilized. Böckmann, cognizant of his soldiers exhaustion, lack of supplies and political time pressure, attempted to batter his way across the bridges. Once large enough bridgeheads had been established, he would use his superior forces to break through the Polish lines and march straight to Warsaw to crush the revolution before it had gained enough steam. Anticipating this, Piłsudski fought as hard as possible to slow the Centurian advance across Vistula, succeeding in bringing the enemy to a crawl while Polish cavalry and motorized units swung both north and south. Despite the Polish resistance, by the 26th of August, Centurian forces managed to connect their bridgeheads together and make decisive breakthroughs in key points along the faltering Polish lines. Unaware of his predicament, Böckmann ordered yet more advances into the Polish lines, sensing victory was near. Piłsudski’s gambit paid off on the 28th, as the final Centurian rail network was severed by Polish cavalry and motorized units rampaging through the nearly unprotected rear. Cut off from communication and supplies, Böckmann’s men found themselves encircled, fighting against an ever growing Polish resistance. General Böckmann finally offered his surrender on the 11th of November. Böckmann’s 16,000 soldiers who had survived the fighting, starvation and frostbite were allowed to return home immediately by Piłsudski, and would be vital in restoring order to the now anarchic Prussia.

### Post war reconstruction

The Emergency Council crowned Piotr Poniatowski as 1st King of Poland on the 8th of January, 1919. The Emergency Council drafted the Polish Constitution, dividing political power between three entities, similar to the Britannian system:

- The Sejm, representing the interests of the peasants and workers.
- The Upper House, representing the interests of the elite and land owners.
- The King, representing the interests of the Polish people as a whole.

The newly created state would work to restore order to the eastern border and cities over the following years, as well as looking outwards to engage in diplomacy with the outside world.

### Cooperation with Brittania

Seeking to maintain order and develop influence on the unstable continent post imperial collapse, The Empire of Brittania sought cooperation and to provide assistance in the emerging continental states. British envoys to the emergency council heavily influenced the creation of the Polish constitution as well as other institutions like the police, judiciary.

### Organized Crime

From the perspective of the criminal and mercenary groups within the lawless Russian lands, Poland serves as the gateway to Europe. Polish ports and border outposts are significantly easier to smuggle goods through than those better policed in Centuria and Anderia. Due to this, Poland has struggled with organized crime and corruption, with gangs and mercenary groups extorting civilians, bribing officials and smuggling goods and people from Russia through to Central Europe.

### Demographics

The vast majority of Poland’s citizens are Christian Poles. German, Jewish, and Orc enclaves exist in small pockets across the nation. Relations with these ethnic minorities within Poland is the responsibility of the Monarch. Historic Jewish and Orcish communities were granted special permission to administrate and police their own communities by King Piotr in the first few years of his reign.
