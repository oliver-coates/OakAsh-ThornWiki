## Overview

Ferrobending is an is a rare innate genetic ability found amongst sentient humanoids, and on exceeding rare occasions, dragons. Ferrobending allows the user to manipulate the position of ferrous-metal atoms which are either directly in contact with their skin or in contact with a chain of ferrous-metal atoms which lead back to skin contact.

Ferrobending has had significant impact on civilization, with ferrobenders dominating the battlefield, even after the invention of gunpowder.

Ferrobenders of exceptional ability are known as 'titans', and are destructive forces on the battlefield, capable of turning entire battles and killing thousands in single engagements. 

Ferrobending is considered a demonic phenomena as it breaks thermodynamic and Newtonian laws.

## Laws of Ferrobending

The seven primary laws of Ferrobending are laid out by Dutch scientist Dr Erich Faulkner's study *Observations and Classification of the Ferrobending Phenomena*, published in 1789.

1. Metallic matter may be compelled to change its position by a ferrobender.
2. Metallic matter may only move if a portion of it is in contact with a ferrobenders skin.
3. When Metallic matter is being compelled, the effects of gravity upon it is reduced by a factor of 16.
4. Metallic matter of pure iron is the easiest to compel. Metallic matter further from iron is more difficult to compel.
5. Metallic matter becomes more difficult to compel as distance to the ferrobender increases.
6. Ferrobending consumes the users red blood cells.
7. The difficulty of ferrobending, and the consumption of red blood cells, is dependent upon the ferrobenders position upon the Faulkner scale.

##### Additional Notes:
While the effect of gravity is reduced greatly, the mass of a ferrobender retains the metal that they are wielding.

> *"The elf woman, who I had been talking to only a moment before, rounded the corner of the warehouse. What had been a lean youngster, barely an inch above 5 feet, looked positively terrifying now coated in half the steel pulled from a locomotive's boiler. The elf yelled out a warning in a voice not quite befitting her imposing, 6ft tall, metallic frame. I struck out blindly with the end of rifle which miraculously caught the werewolf's snout. The beast reeled and I leapt aside as over a ton of elf and steel charged past me. She tackled the werewolf and then took it through three whole brick walls before finally coming to a stop.\"* 

The speed at which metal can be compelled is determined by the difficulty of the metal and the ferrobenders ability.

Ferrobenders are not able to "feel", through controlled metal. Though they are granted an additional sense, allowing them to understand which bits of metal are under their control, and a vague awareness of the surroundings of controlled metal, dependent of ferrobending ability and proximity of the metal to the ferrobenders skin.

### The Faulkner scale
The Faulkner scale measures a person's "attunement" to their ferrobending ability.

Dr Faulkner saw fit to divide users into 8 tiers of ability, measured in "Faulkner", or "Fauls" for short. While all ferrobenders differ in their precise ability, the division into 8 segments provides an easy heuristic for someone to gauge ferrobending ability.

To determine where an individual sits on each scale, Faulkner devised the Ferrobending Aptitude Test.

##### Ferrobending Aptitude Test
In this test, a subject attempts to complete a series of tasks which indicates their ferrobending ability. 

Faulkner stresses that each task must be completed *"comfortably, and without undue strain on the participant"*. 

As such, following the completion of the highest difficulty task, the participant must complete a 2 mile run, without fainting due to blood deficiency.

#### Improvement through Practice
Like with fleshworking, a ferrobender will be able to increase their attunement through the use of their abilities.

All beginner ferrobenders start at an ability of 1 Fauls and quickly gain aptitude as they practice. Predetermined genetic factors determine one's "potential" for ferrobending - The highest possible Faulkner tier they can achieve.

Gains in ferrobending ability start off quickly, and diminish with experience as one approaches their potential.

## Ferrobending abilities

The most obvious use of ferrobending is the formation of tools and disruption of metal constructions. Ferrobenders make terrifying adversaries in hand to hand combat, given their ability to rearrange a given metal weapons composition, mid swing or thrust.

Ferrobenders have the ability to 'melt' locks and fuse other metal components together, like engines or handcuffs.
##### Steelskin
Ferrobenders of 2 Fauls and higher have the ability to meld metal to cover their skin, known as a 'steelskin', providing them with enhanced protection and greater mass. Combat ferrobenders of significant ability are commonly used as assault infantry, capable of surviving bullets and shrapnel.

Prior to the invention of gunpowder, ferrobenders needed only to be able to protect themselves against bladed and blunt instruments. Allowing the steelskin to be worn atop of clothes.

In the modern day however, combat ferrobenders require every additional millimetre of thickness in protection against bullets, explosives and shrapnel. Combat ferrobenders wear clothing atop their steelskin, allowing for more even and efficient metal distribution, but leaving ferrobenders highly vulnerable to the cold. The effect of metal against bare skin or thin under layers commonly results in ferrobenders becoming exhausted or suffering hypothermia in cold battles.

Ferrobenders will specifically tailor the blend of metals used in their steelskin to give a good balance of mobility, mass, and protection, while still being sustainable within their ferrobending ability. 

Vision from within a steelskin varies based on the ability of the ferrobender. While keeping close against the skin for the rest of the body, ferrobenders will fashion the metal protecting their heads into different shapes, give greater protection and allowing for external vision. 
- Lower Faul ferrobenders commonly form their head protection into two planes, one running perpendicular to each cheek, allowing for a slanted horizontal slit to give vision. Similar to that of knights armour.
- Higher Faul ferrobenders take artistic license with their head protection, taking its design as a point of pride. The finer control over their metal allows them to have finer slits or grills for vision.

When two ferrobenders engage in hand to hand combat, each assailant will attempt to 'tear' pieces of the other's steelskin off and throw it away, hoping to weaken the average thickness or leave an exposed hole from which the assailant's body can be damaged. Ferrobenders engaged in a fistfight engage in a delicate balance of shifting metal to different parts of their body as they lose more of their steelskin.

##### Ferromuscle
Ferrobenders of sufficient ability (5+ Fauls) find themselves able to intuitively form the metal on their steelskin into an external musculature, which grants them significant additional strength.

High Faul ferrobenders can be differentiated from lower Faul ferrobenders by the appearance of their steelskins.
- Low Faul steelskins appear as an extension, or expansion, of the body it encompasses. This can make wearers appear clumsy and bloated in some cases.
- High Faul steelskins, which utilize ferromuscle, appear leaner and more agile, the rare sight of which inspiring dread within enemy soldiers.

The significant additional strength provided by ferromuscle gives ferrobenders the ability to lift many times their body weight, sprint at speeds comparable to motor vehicles and leap great distances into the air. Controlling the huge weight of the steelskin becomes the primary problem for high Faul ferrobenders.

> *"For twelve hours my section had held our position in that frozen muddy field. Thrice the Brittanians tried to break us and yet we held, barely. But with each repulsed advance their machine gun teams moved closer. On the morning of the 12th, they tried again - This time with the support of their dreaded tanks. By this point were long out of rounds for our heavy rifle, and so we cowered in the trench, grenades in hand, all praying. As the first of the tanks lumbered atop of our trench, the Lord answered our prayer. A terrible screech could be heard as one of our ferrobenders slammed straight through the tank. With his weight and the speed that he was moving, he didn't even need to move the metal. The great steel beast contorted inwards as the man-sized projectile ripped through the front order and out the opposing side. The enemy infantry opened fire almost immediately upon him, and we readied our rifles to support our savior. Looking over the trench was a tremendous sight. Machine gun fire, illuminated perfectly in the dim Swedish morning, streamed towards the ferrobender from various positions. The rounds glanced off his metal body as he dashed across the field faster than a horse at full gallop. The smoke and the distance obscured the carnage, but I watched as best I could. The men in the Britannian advanced positions were torn in two or simply pulverized upon being slammed into by the metal behemoth. Once the machine guns fell silent and the tanks were retreating, he returned to our trench. The gleaming metal muscles across his body were coated in both mud and man, easily visible beneath the tattered remains of his thick trench coat."*

##### Anti-Armour
Any ferrobender has the potential to deliver significant damage to tanks and other armoured vehicles by tearing holes through armour and compelling metallic mechanical pieces to become inoperable.

A ferrobender of a sufficient ability (Usually 4-5 Fauls) has the ability to crush a tank through the touch of a hand, killing the crew. As such, anti-ferrobending measures, such as a thick zinc coating or wood panelling, are instituted on modern tanks in an attempt to improve tank suitability.


## Prevalence & Geographic Distribution

Active ferrobending is typically passed down through family lineages. Being a recessive genetic feature, Ferrobending can, through chance, become dormant even with two ferrobending parents or become active in child to two non-ferrobending parents.

Active ferrobenders exhibiting an ability of 2 Fauls or higher typically make up less than 2% of eligible populations. Ferrobending has a strong geographic prevalence in [[Republic of Centuria|Centuria]], with Prussia having an estimated 7% of its population 2+ Faul ferrobenders.

## History

During the Dragon Age, prominent ferrobending families would quickly enter the elite class through military service of a dragon lord. In the case of the Centurian and Roman Empires, local dragon lords would ensure ferrobenders served as commanders of military units. This ensured that, when waging war or crushing rebellion, each military detachment would be hold an extreme advantage against regular enemy forces.

Prior to the invention of gunpowder, high-Faul Ferrobenders were the only weapon capable to kill dragons, and as such were considered highly dangerous.

Ferrobenders born from non-ferrobending parents would be shunned or killed at a young age in an effort to keep subject populations subservient.

High-Faul ferrobenders, primarily ones of titan class, would stand as the figurehead of Human, Elf and Orc sovereignty movements. Many titan class ferrobenders would achieve god-like adoration from populations, and would be the basis for many monarchic bloodlines which would form Human nations following the end of the Dragon age.

## Countering Ferrobenders

Prior to the invention of gunpowder, a ferrobender could only be reliably bested in combat by another ferrobender. Catapults, ballistas and hot oil were rarely successful.

Dragons would attempt to burn a ferrobender alive within their steelskin through their firebreath. Infamous battles of old would consist of dragons raining fire upon a defiant ferrobender, who would attempt to leap into the dragon as dived down to rain fire.

As the Age of Man begun, small swivel cannons, known as 'plate breakers', would soon be developed. Originally only powerful enough to defeat plate armour, these small calibre, horse-draw, swivel cannons quickly grew in size, allowing entrenched infantry to somewhat resist ferrobender assault. Firing round shot from non-rifled barrels, these cannons were extremely inaccurate. The small cannons would be hand-aimed, made possible by a highly complex and unreliable swivel joint mounted to a wooden cart.

As larger cannons entered the battlefield in the mid 1700s, alongside muskets, massed ferrobender assaults found themselves struck by concentrated artillery fire. Subsequently, ferrobenders were forced to be distributed amongst regular line infantry, acting as point-men and officers as they were immune to musket fire.

Small handmade explosives were also found to be partially effective against ferrobenders at this time. Grenades, initially being made by sailors for use in naval boarding actions, were quickly adapted to use by 'Grenadier' infantry. The explosive force from grenades can stun, concuss or even kill ferrobenders if lucky, but are mostly ineffective against the thicker steelskins used by high-Faul ferrobenders.

Rifled barrels arrived in Europe in the early 1800s and quickly revolutionised combat. Plate breakers became smaller and more reliable. Designated plate breaker teams, consisting of multiple men carrying a mobile gun and its ammunition were first employed by the English and Irish rebels during the Brittanian Revolutionary war. These modernised plate breakers could be disassembled and reassembled in minutes, were substantially more accurate and boasted a much faster fire rate through the use of cartridges, rather than powder. These guns allowed the Brittanian infantry to reliably hold their own against unsupported ferrobender attacks, provided the requisite time for assembly and entrenchment had been given.

As the 1st Continental war broke out in 1914, industrialised production of military goods allowed the Centurian and Brittanian armies to field man-portable high-calibre breech loading rifles in large number. These anti-ferrobender rifles, known as 'ferro-rifles', 'f-rifles', 'plate-guns' or simply 'can-openers' gave a single infantry man a decent chance at wounding or killing a ferrobender for the first time in history. High-Faul ferrobenders still faced minimal threat however, Low-Faul ferrobenders, making up the majority of the any armies armoured force, faced a new threat. In the summer of 1914, the Centurian Empire faced horrendous ferrobender losses on the Kalmar front as they met the small, but well trained Brittanian Expeditionary Force armed with hundreds of Enfield LAP no. 1s (Enfield armoury, long, armour piercing, 1st model) ferro-rifles.

Ferro-rifles were would be rushed into production alongside machine-guns, as both sides grappled with the changing nature of war.

By 1918, as the Continental war came to a close, the
